	The main difference that I can tell, just like the instructions says is when I run git branch on both. On the one
	located on the seasnet server 2 different branches come up. maint and master. Master of course is as expected,
	since that is the defualt "main" branch. But the maint branch is a local branch. As we know git branch simiply,
	will list all of the branches that exist in the repo. After some research, the maint branch is used for maintenance
	releases. i.e it contains bug fixes that can be applied to previous stable versions of git, that don't introduce any
	new features. I attempted to switch into the maint branch, via git checkout maint, but got a permission denied error.
	Comparing this to the git branch I cloned from github, no such maint branch exists. This is because the maint branch
	is a local branch (aka you must create it via git branch maint), and local branchs can't be cloned from a repo on github,
	because when you push a change, your pushing the change to the main branch not the local branch(since the local branch already
	has that change).
