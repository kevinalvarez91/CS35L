	Step 1:
	    The first command that I ran was ls -la, this gave me all the files and directories(hidden to). From this I understood,
	    there is simply too many files to go through, and cat | grep "Even newspaper...". I looked at the grep man page to see
	    if there was a solution to this (as this should be a common problem), and I found the -r option, which allows you to
	    recursively search through files and directorys. So I ran the following command
	    		-> ls -la | grep -r "Even newspaper reports present contraditory information."
			   -> Output: ./northamerica:# and wrote "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information."
			This means that the source file that was changed was ./northamerica...
	Step 2:
	     I navigated into the file, using emacs northamerica. From there I did C-s (incremental search), and typed in
	     "Even newspaper reports present contraditory information.". This is located on line number 883.
	Step 3:
	     Next I tried git log --reverse northamerica, in the hopes that I would see the introduction of "Even ...", in
	     the first couple of commits. Unfortuantly I was incorrect.
	Step 4:
	     I then tried git log -S "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information". northamerica
	       -> This only presented one single outcome, making the filtering much easier.
	Step 5:
	     This string was introduced in the commit pushed by Arthur David Olson, on the 21st of Dec 1995.
	     The commit message was Eggert changes, which leads me to believe Prof Eggert, has made some changes,
	     but it was push to the repo by Arthur.
